# On Eating

I hate eating food.

Eating food makes me fatigue and lethargic, and the oil would persist on my lips, which makes me uncomfortable, so I do not like eating food.

Besides, I believe that students should obtain energy not by eating food, but by the potential energy that comes from the drop between the abundant knowledge in textbooks and the insufficient knowledge in students' brains.

Moreover, from my perspective, the responsibilities of students are none other than learning and sleeping.

In this sense, the philosophers are more fortunate. The responsibilities of philosophers are none other than thinking and eating, as I have learnt in my operating system class.

``` C
// Initialize semaphore
semaphore chopstick[5] = {1,1,1,1,1};
semaphore mutex = 1;       // The semaphore of taking chopsticks
Pi() {                     // The process of the i-th philosopher
  do {
    P(mutex);
    P(chopstick[i]);       // Take the chopstick on the left hand side
    P(chopstick[(i+1)%5]); // Take the chopstick on the right hand side
    V(mutex);
    eat;                   // Eat
    V(chopstick[i]);       // Put the chopstick on the left hand side
    V(chopstick[(i+1)%5]); // Put the chopstick on the right hand side
    think;                 // Think
  } while(1);
}
```
